octli
=========

* Javascript for validating the user's age before allowing the access to any of the pages of the site.
* Simple example illustrating the use of the js (for non-SquareSpace sites).
* Explanation of installation in SquareSpace without turning developer mode on.

octli means alcohol in nahuatl. I chose that name because I initially wrote these scripts for an age verification page for
a local brewery.
